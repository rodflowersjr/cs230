    Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client I had was The Gaming Room. They wanted to find an operating system that would best help their game reach the largest audience while maintaining proper scalability, security, and performance. 
    
    What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe I explained my reasoning well for why I believe Linux to be the best OS for The Gaming Room to build their game for.
    
    What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
It was most helpful comparing and contrasting Windows, Mac, Linux, and mobile operating systems. I believe I now have a better understanding of why some apps work for some OS's while they don't work well for the others. 
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise my comparisons. I don't believe I articulated well on the chart the differences between each operating system. I would take my time and really delve deep into why these systems are so different as well as tracking the similarities between each one as well.
    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I saw that the user needs something cost effective and scalable for their game. It is important to take the user's needs as input for decision-making because at the end of it, they will be the ones left with the application. I would not want to give them something that doesn't meet their criteria, especially in the event that I am being paid to provide a product that confines to their specifications.
    
    How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I design software based on how much use it will get and by who. I try to ensure that the user experience is simple and streamlined to provide the best possible situation for the user. I like the comparison chart the most, so I will use that more on the personal projects I make.
